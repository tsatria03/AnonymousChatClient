anonymous chat client!
***What is this?
anonymous chat client is a simple program to chat in realtime with people. You can choose to be anonymous or you can set a name. There is no accounts, no chat logging, nothing. Please keep in mind that whatever is said in the client does not, and should not, be taken seriously. It is mainly written with the intention of having fun, and experimentation.
++Useage
When opening the program for the first time, the client will generate a name for you. You can keep the name or change it in options. Other than that, pretty simple. Just click connect, and have fun.
